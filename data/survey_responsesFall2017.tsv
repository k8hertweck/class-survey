Do you have any experience with computer science (taken classes, workshops, self taught)?	Are you planning to use your own laptop during class this semester?	If you answered yes to the question above, what operating system does it run? If you answered no, with which operating system are you most familiar?	I access most class materials through my mobile device (phone/tablet) rather than a desktop computer	I prefer to read from paper, rather than electronically	I consider myself to be "really good at computers" or a "computer geek"	I'm comfortable managing files and directories on a standard PC (like you'd find in a computer lab)	I regularly archive (back up) computer files for my classes and/or personal use	I have experience working with data stored in remote servers	Computer skills will be essential to my future profession	I'm confident in my knowledge of statistics	I'm comfortable performing statistical tests and building graphs using software like Microsoft Excel	I'm interested in improving my data analysis capabilities	I feel prepared to apply knowledge from my other biology classes to address interesting research questions	I'm confident in my knowledge of molecular genetics (eg, DNA sequences)	I'm comfortable speaking in large group discussions, such as with the entire class	I'm comfortable speaking in small group discussions	My advisor is making me take this course	What about this class makes you most apprehensive?	What are you most interested in learning this semester?
No	No		4	1	4	1	1	5	1	5	5	1	1	3	1	1	4	Knowing nothing about writing codes/etc	Overall bioinformatics and statistical skills
No	Yes	MacOSX	4	3	3	2	2	4	2	3	3	1	2	2	1	1	1	The fact that it's split between two days, but I know it's out of your control 	I'm interested in learning how to analyze data and create graphs that express the information effectively 
Yes (self-taught)	Yes	MacOSX	5	5	1	1	3	3	1	1	1	1	1	2	1	4	5	possibility of small groups (prefer presenting or independent work); only 5 grades/assignments	Data analysis and advancing my programming skills
Yes (self-taught)	Yes	Windows	5	3	5	2	5	4	1	4	2	1	1	2	1	1	3	The learning curve for a stats program will take time so I am concerned that I may not learn everything I need to know by the end of the semester   I understand that I cannot learn EVERYTHING but I was hoping to get a very good basic understanding of both R and Unix I also want to have a solid understanding of what stats to use when, how stats can be manipulated, what is a "good" stat vs "bad" stat, etc	I am most interested in learning R stats (for sure!) and Unix, but I would also like to know more about stats in general (when to use what test, why, how does it normalize data, etc) I feel like my undergraduate courses have said "Use this stat test" without giving me a good understanding of WHY (why use this test over another test?)   Also, I am a somewhat familiar with JMP (I used it in a summer internship) but I would also be interested in learning more about that program
No	Yes	Windows	2	3	4	2	5	4	2	4	3	1	2	3	2	2	5	I don't feel confident in using statistics to analyze data 	I would like to be able to utilize statistics and computer power in understanding and presenting experimental data 
Yes (completed semester-long classes or workshops)	Yes	Windows	5	3	2	1	3	1	1	2	3	1	1	2	1	1	1	Nothing, I am excited to get started!	I am interesting in gaining more experience working with data sets and sharpening my skills right before I graduate
Yes (completed semester-long classes or workshops)	Yes	MacOSX	5	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	5	Nothing in particular I am happy to be sitting in	Data parsing
Yes (completed semester-long classes or workshops)	Yes	Windows	3	5	2	2	2	2	1	2	2	1	1	1	1	1	3	I am less apprehensive than last time	How to batch download Fasta files ;)
Yes (completed semester-long classes or workshops)	Yes	MacOSX	5	3	2	1	1	2	1	2	1	1	1	1	1	1	5	Daunting what I don't know!	Efficient and reproducible coding
No	Yes	MacOSX	4	3	5	3	3	5	1	2	2	1	1	1	2	1	3	struggling with the abstract concepts which arise when trying to troubleshoot code 	I am excited to learn to code and to better understand how computers work
No	Yes	Windows	4	1	3	2	4	2	1	5	2	1	2	2	2	1	5	I'm worried that my lack of statistical expertise may hinder me from effectively applying the skills I learn in this classlike being given a car without understanding how to drive 	How to make sense of the thesis data I've collected so far 
Yes (completed semester-long classes or workshops)	Yes	Windows	5	5	3	3	1	5	1	2	1	1	1	5	1	1	1	The fact that I have absolutely no experience in coding	I honestly will learn whatever I have the ability to learn in a course  I don't have any particular goals for learning in the course  I'm down for the ride
No	Yes	MacOSX	5	2	4	4	4	5	2	3	3	2	1	2	1	1	1	Having a reliable computer to code on	Coding, anything to tie biology to computers
No	Yes	MacOSX	4	1	5	2	2	5	1	2	2	1	2	1	4	2	1	I am not good with computers I can do the basics but I had trouble connecting a printer to my computer two days ago 	Hopefully, confidence in myself and my ability to learn a new skill I'm interested in learning the basics/fundamentals of bioinformatics, because I know nothing of the subject 
No	No		2	2	5	4	4	5	1	2	2	1	1	2	3	2	5	I feel like my limited knowledge about computers will slow me down and put me behind from the rest of the class 	Learning how to code! I always have wanted to add that to my skill set!
